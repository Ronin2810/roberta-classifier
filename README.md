# VaxVerdict: A Roberta-based Multilabel Classifier

## Overview

VaxVerdict is a powerful multilabel tweet classifier developed as part of our participation in the Forum of Information Retrieval and Evaluation Conference held on December 13-18, 2023, at the University of Goa. The project specifically contributed to the AI in Social Media Track, addressing the critical task of classifying COVID-19 related tweets into 12 distinct classes.

## Key Features

- **Roberta-Based Model:** Leveraging the advanced capabilities of the Roberta model for effective tweet classification.
  
- **Multilabel Classification:** Handling the complexity of assigning multiple relevant labels to each tweet.

- **Macro-F1 Score of 0.66:** Demonstrating the model's robust performance with a competitive macro-F1 score.

## Conference Participation

Our group presented this project at the conference, showcasing its significance in the AI community, particularly in the context of social media analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic.
